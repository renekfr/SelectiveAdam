# Selective Adam

Selective Adam is an optimizer based on Adam that enables selective parameter updates by applying a visibility mask to the gradients. Initially designed for 3DGS, it can be used in any project that requires targeted parameter updates.

## Features

- **Selective Update**: Only the portions of the parameters corresponding to "visibility" (as defined by a mask) are updated. Either all parameters are updated!
- **Adam-Inspired**: Leverages adaptive learning rates through exponential moving averages and bias corrections.
- **Easy Integration**: Built to work seamlessly with PyTorch, making it simple to integrate into your projects.
- **Open Source**: Distributed under the MIT license, you are free to use and modify it as needed.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renekfr/SelectiveAdam.git
cd SelectiveAdam
```

## Results
### 3DGS Ray Tracer | 7K Iter | Truck Dataset
#### Adam
ðŸ’¡SSIM    :  0.854
ðŸ’¡PSNR    : 25.227

#### Selective Adam
ðŸ’¡SSIM    :  0.850
ðŸ’¡PSNR    : 25.111

## Discussion

I did some test and lost a bit of PSNR / SSIM using selective Adam.
Ie. A fix is maybe needed?
